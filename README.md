## Hi, I’m Chiranth 👋

I’m an **Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) undergraduate** with a strong focus on **embedded systems, robotics, drones, and hardware–software co-design**.

I enjoy building systems where ideas move beyond theory into **robust, real-world implementations**. My interests lie in **defence, healthcare, surveillance, and public-impact engineering**, where clarity, reliability, and engineering discipline matter more than buzzwords.

I primarily work through **project-based learning**, taking end-to-end ownership — from system architecture and component selection to integration, testing, and iterative refinement.
